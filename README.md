This is the repository for my javascript project made up for start2impact!







*********JAVASCRIPT ***************
This JavaScript code creates a counter that allows you to increase or decrease the value using two buttons. When the page loads, the code creates a section h1 showing the initial value of the counter (0) and two buttons, one to increase the value and one to decrease it.

The code uses three functions to create the different elements:

    createCounterText() creates the h1 section which shows the value of the counter
    createIncreaseButton() creates the button to increment the value
    createDecreaseButton() creates the button to decrease the value

The code also uses two functions to handle math calculations:

    incrementNumber() increases the value of the counter by 1
    reduceNumber() decrements the counter value by 1, with a check to prevent the value from going negative

In the end, the code uses three setTimeouts to create a transition animation for the different elements. The background of the body is set to "#b0c4de".
